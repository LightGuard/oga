## 0.2.0 - Unreleased

The `node_type` method has been removed and its purpose has been moved into
the `XML::PullParser` class itself. This method was solely used by the pull
parser to provide shorthands for node classes. As such it doesn't make sense to
expose this as a method to the outside world as a public method.

## 0.1.1 - 2014-09-13

This release fixes a problem where element attributes were not separated by
spaces. Thanks to Jonathan Rochkind for reporting it and Bill Dueber providing
an initial patch for this problem.

## 0.1.0 - 2014-09-12

The first public release of Oga. This release contains support for parsing XML,
basic support for parsing HTML, support for querying documents using XPath and
more.
